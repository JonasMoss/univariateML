Each function:
	Add na.rm as second argument to each function and the test.
	Add test for support of x.
	Add object to each function, e.g:
	  names(object) = c("shape1", "shape2")
	  class(object) = "univariateML"
	  attr(object, "model") = "Beta"
	  attr(object, "logLik") = 
	  attr(object, "support" = c(-Inf, Inf)
	  object
	
Documentation of functions: Later.

Standardized interface, eg:
	- x
	- na.rm: Remove or not remove NAs.
	- method: List of function-specific parameters, if applicable.
	- control: List of control parameters to the optimizer, if applicable.

Standardized tests:
	- Check response to NA:
		1. Error when data contains NA and na.rm = FALSE (default)
		2. Same response for NA and non-NA.
	- Make covr 100%: Use all control and method combinations.
	- Check for correctness on minimal examples:
		- parameter estimates
		- log-likelihood

univariateML class:
	- Named numeric vector of parameters corresponding to the first parameters of some density.
	- Attributes:
		- Name of the class.
		- Package of the class.
		- Log-likelihood.

Make generics:
	- logLik (and AIC, BIC by extension)
	- confint (asymptotic theory) // maybe wait with this?
	- dml, pml, qml, rml (wrapper around already existing functions)
	- plot, lines, points
	- print, summary
	
Make functions:
	- qqml (qqplot for univariateML objects)
