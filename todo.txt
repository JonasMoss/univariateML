Make "standardized" tests

Make base ML:
	stats:					Basic 	Tests	Ver		Na.rm	LogLik	Notes 
		dbeta				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Sufficient statistics.
		dweibull			✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Solution reusing values.
		dgamma				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Sufficient statistics.
		dexp				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		dlnorm				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		dnorm				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		dunif				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		dcauchy				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Note: Check for unimodality; add exact solutions for n < 5.
		dlogis				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Search literature for existence of solutions.
		dchisq														Low priority; not used for modelling often.
		df															Low priority; not used for modelling often.
		dt															Low priority; not used for modelling often.
		dwilcox														No implementation: Never used for modelling.
		
	extraDistr:
		InvGamma			✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Transformation of Gamma. Sufficient statistics.
		Laplace				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		Wald 				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		Rayleigh			✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		Pareto				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution.
		Lomax				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Single-dimensional Newton-Raphson; non-concave and does not always exist. Look at more later.
		Gumbel				✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Reduced to 1-dim; Solution reusing values.
		Kumaraswamy 		✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Reduced to 1-dim; Solution reusing values.
		BetaPrime			✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Transformation of beta. Sufficient statistics.
		PowerDist			✓		✓		✓		✓		✓		Explicit solution. The extraDistr setup is arguably wrong.

		TruncNormal													Sufficient statistics; numerically unstable?
		GEV															Asymptotic normality holds
		Gompertz
		ShiftGomp
		GPD
		LocationScaleT												See fit.mle.t in cggmisc.
		BirnbaumSaunders 										
		NormalMix													No implementation. Non-parametric. Too hard to solve.	
		Triangular 													No implementation. Usually not used for modelling.
		Bhattacharjee												No implementation. Usually not used for modelling.
		HalfCauchy													No implementation. Usually not used for modelling.
		HalfNormal 													No implementation. Usually not used for modelling.
		HalfT														No implementation. Usually not used for modelling.

		InvChiSq													No implementation. Usually not used for modelling.
		
	other:
		Foldnorm													Sufficient statistics. In VGAM package.
		LogLogistic													Transform of logistic. In Actuary package
		LogitNormal													Transform of normal. LogitNormal package.
		GenGamma													Generalized gamma. Maybe use Weibull algorithm? In flexsurv package. 
		EMG															In package emg.
