#' univariateML
#'
#' An \code{R}-package for fast, easy, and reliable maximum likelihood estimation for a
#' selection of parametric univariate densities.
#'
#' Data analysis often requires the estimation of univariate densities. Maximum likelihood estimation
#' is sensible for almost every univariate density used in practice. Moreover,
#' the maximum likelihood estimator is typically consistent and efficient.
#'
#' The purpose of this package is to
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Support maximum likelihood estimation of a large selection of densities.
#'   \item Supports plenty of generics such as \code{plot} and \code{AIC} to aid your data analysis.
