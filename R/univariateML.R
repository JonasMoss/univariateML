#' univariateML
#'
#' An \code{R}-package for fast, easy, and reliable maximum likelihood estimation for a
#' selection of parameteric univariate densities.
#'
#' Data analysis often requieres the estimation of univariate densities. For
#' almost all univariate densities maximum likelihood estimation is sensible and
#' gives consistent and efficient estimators. The purpose of this package is to
#' do maximum for a large number of densities
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item It supports maximum likelihood estimation of a large selection of densities.
#'   \item It supports plently of generics such as \code{plot} and \code{AIC} which aids in data analysis.
