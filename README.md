## Overview

An `R`-package for fast, easy, and reliable maximum likelihood
estimation for a selection of parameteric univariate densities. In
addition to basic estimation capabilities, this package support
visualization through `plot` and `qqmlplot`, model selection by `AIC`
and `BIC`, and confidence sets through the parametric bootstrap with
`bootstrapml`.

## Installation

From inside `R`, use one of the following commands:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/univariateML")
```

## Example Usage

``` r
library("univariateML")
mlweibull(egypt$age)
#> Maximum likelihood estimates for the Weibull model 
#>  shape   scale  
#>  1.404  33.564
```

``` r
hist(egypt$age, freq = FALSE, xlab = "Mortality", main = "Egypt")
lines(mlweibull(egypt$age))
```

## Documentation

For an overview of the package and its features see the [overview
vignette](/vignettes/overview.html). For a list of implemented densities
see the start of the [details vignette](/vignettes/distributions.html).
For an application of the package to copula modelling see the [copula
vignette](/vignettes/copula.html).
