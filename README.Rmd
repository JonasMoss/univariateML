## Overview
An `R`-package for fast, easy, and reliable maximum likelihood estimation for a 
[selection](/vignettes/distributions.html) of parameteric univariate densities. In addition to basic estimation capabilities,
this package support visualization through `plot` and `qqmlplot`, model selection
by `AIC` and `BIC`, and confidence sets through the parametric bootstrap with
`bootstrapml`.

## Installation
From inside `R`, use the following command:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/univariateML")
```

## Usage

The core of `univariateML` are the `ml***` functions, where `****` is a 
distribution suffix such as `norm`, `gamma`, or `weibull`.

```{R, mlweibull}
library("univariateML")
mlweibull(egypt$age)
```

Now we can visually assess the fit of the Weibull model to the `egypt` data with
a plot.

```{R, weibull_plot}
hist(egypt$age, freq = FALSE, xlab = "Mortality", main = "Egypt")
lines(mlweibull(egypt$age))
```

## Documentation
For an overview of the package and its features see the 
[overview vignette](/vignettes/overview.html). For a list of implemented 
densities see the start of the [details vignette](/vignettes/distributions.html). 
For an illustration of how this package can make an otherwise long and laborious process
much simpler, see the [copula vignette](/vignettes/copula.html).

## How to Contribute or Get Help
If you encounter a bug, have a feature request or need some help, open a [Github issue](https://github.com/JonasMoss/univariateML/issues). 
If you miss a particular estimator, make an issue explaining why its implementation should be prioritized. 

We encourage you to make a pull request if you wish to make a contribution to this package. 
If you wish to contribute a new maximum likelihood estimator to this package please read [this page first](https://github.com/JonasMoss/univariateML/wiki/Adding-New-Densities).
