## Overview
An `R`-package for fast, easy, and reliable maximum likelihood estimation for a 
selection of parameteric univariate densities. In addition to basic estimation capabilities,
this package support visualization through `plot` and `qqmlplot`, model selection
by `AIC` and `BIC`, and confidence sets through the parametric bootstrap with
`bootstrapml`.

## Installation
From inside `R`, use the following command:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/univariateML")
```

## Example Usage

```{R, mlweibull}
library("univariateML")
mlweibull(egypt$age)
```

```{R, weibull_plot}
hist(egypt$age, freq = FALSE, xlab = "Mortality", main = "Egypt")
lines(mlweibull(egypt$age))
```

## Documentation
For an overview of the package and its features see the 
[overview vignette](/vignettes/overview.html). For a list of implemented 
densities see the start of the [details vignette](/vignettes/distributions.html). 
For an application of the package to copula modelling see the 
[copula vignette](/vignettes/copula.html).

## How to Contribute or Get Help
If you encounter a bug, have a feature request or need some help, open a [Github issue](https://github.com/JonasMoss/univariateML/issues). Create a pull requests
to contribute. This project follows a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md).

If you want to contribute a new maximum likelihood estimator to this package please read [this page](https://github.com/JonasMoss/univariateML/wiki/Adding-New-Densities). If you miss a particular estimator,
make an issue explaining why its implementation should be prioritized.
