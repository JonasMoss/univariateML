## Overview
[`univariateML`](https://jonasmoss.github.io/univariateML/index.html) is an `R`-package for
user-friendly maximum likelihood estimation of a
[selection](https://jonasmoss.github.io/univariateML/articles/distributions.html) of parametric univariate densities and probability mass functions. In addition to basic estimation capabilities,
this package support visualization through `plot` and `qqmlplot`, model selection
by `AIC` and `BIC`, confidence sets through the parametric bootstrap with
`bootstrapml`, and convenience functions such as the density, distribution 
function, quantile function, and random sampling at the estimated distribution
parameters.

## Installation
Use the following command from inside `R` to install from CRAN.
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("univariateML")
```

Or install the development version from Github.
```{r install_github, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/univariateML")
```

## Usage

The core of `univariateML` are the `ml***` functions, where `***` is a 
distribution suffix such as `norm`, `gamma`, or `weibull`.

```{R, mlweibull}
library("univariateML")
mlweibull(egypt$age)
```

Now we can visually assess the fit of the Weibull model to the `egypt` data with
a plot.

```{R, weibull_plot}
hist(egypt$age, freq = FALSE, xlab = "Mortality", main = "Egypt")
lines(mlweibull(egypt$age))
```

## Implementations

Analytic formulae for the maximum likelihood estimates are used whenever
they exist. Most `ml***` functions without analytic solutions have a custom made
Newton-Raphson solver. These can be much faster than a naïve solution using 
`nlm` or `optim`. For example, `mlbeta` has a large speedup over the naïve
solution using `nlm`.

```{R, beta, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# install.packages("microbenchmark")
set.seed(313)
x <- rbeta(500, 2, 7)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  univariateML = univariateML::mlbeta(x),
  naive = nlm(function(p) -sum(dbeta(x, p[1], p[2], log = TRUE)), p = c(1, 1))
)
```

The maximum likelihood estimators in this package have all been subject to
testing, see the `tests` folder for details.
