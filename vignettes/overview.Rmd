When dealing with univariate data you want to do one or more of
* Find a good model for the data.
* Estimate parameters for your candidate models.
* Get an idea about the uncertainty of your estimates.

The `unvariateML` package has a fast and reliable functions to help you with 
these tasks. The core of the package are more than 20 functions for fast 
and thoroughly tested calculation of maximum likelihood estimates for univariate 
models. 

* Compare the fit of your candidate models with `AIC` or `BIC`.
* Look at QQ plots or PP plots of your data.
* Plot the data together with density estimates.
* Compute confidence intervals using parameteric bootstrap.
